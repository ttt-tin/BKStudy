# Introduction
BKStudy is a website where user can release their own courses to sell or subscribe courses to learn. This is my first Software Engineering project at university where i work with in a team-5 to completely create a website.
# What i do
In this project my work is ideation, requirement definition, UI/UX design, implementation frontend and contribution in backend.
This website is implemented by using ReactJS, NextJS in frontend and NodeJS in backend. First i come up with the idea of a learning courses website like coursera and define the requirement. My team then design the system of that website and i am in the frontend development of the website. Throughout the implementation process, i also review the backend code and manage time for team in order to complete the project just in time.
# How to use
BKStudy is not deployed because this is just out first project and it lack of some feature.
In order to use the code, firstly run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
